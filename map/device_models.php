/**
 * APRS Tracker Map — Apple hardware identifiers, in words.
 *
 * iOS reports `utsname.machine`, and there is no API that gives anything friendlier:
 * UIDevice.model returns the bare string "iPhone", and UIDevice.name has been the app's
 * own name rather than the device's since iOS 16 unless you hold an entitlement. So the
 * app sends the identifier, which is the only thing it can send, and the translation
 * happens here.
 *
 * The numbers do not track the marketing names and are not meant to: the iPhone 15 Pro
 * Max is iPhone16,2, while the plain 15 is iPhone15,4. Reading a generation off the
 * identifier gets you the wrong phone.
 *
 * SERVER-SIDE deliberately. A handset released next spring is then named by editing this
 * file, where a table compiled into the app would leave every phone in the field showing
 * an identifier until each one updated.
 *
 * GENERATED — do not edit by hand. Run map/update-device-models.py, which is where the
 * source and the reasoning live. Last generated 2026-08-24, 172 entries, from
 * https://gist.github.com/adamawolf/3048717 — not written from memory, because a
 * confidently wrong device name is worse than the identifier it replaced.
